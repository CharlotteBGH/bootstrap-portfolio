# Charlotte Brazier portfolio
## Description
This is a Bootstrap recreation of my original portfolio website, which was created with Flexbox, HTML and CSS. Having a sound knowledge of Bootstrap will help to save me time when working on applications as it will mean that I don't have to code everything myself. I have used Bootstrap elements - including a navbar, cards, footer and jumbotron, and styled them using HTML and CSS. It includes sections such as 'About Me', 'Work' and 'Skills I expect to learn', and a hover effect on the links in the navbar and footer.
